Description:
    Explain the generator
    This generator behaves like as pluguin generator
    but it copies your app folder of your application
    to vendor/plugin/<%= file_name %>/app
    
if error A copy of ApplicationController has been removed from the module tree but is still active!
main_app/config/environments/development.rbmake it true if false config.cache_classes = true

Example:
1)./script/generate engine engine_name sourcedir:pluggapleapplicationpath
2)change user_name and password in database.yml
3)rake db:create:all
4)rake db:migrate

If database is other than mysql change database.yml
if source_dir is not given then copies own app folder
The above generator copy your source application app folder to vendor/app/#{engine_name}/app
Copy routes.rb
Check that route file any map.root or any map.{...} change as needed 
It update database.yml file added another mysql adapter named with engine_name_dev with engine_name_dev database
Change username and password 
Then rake db:create:all or create database manually
rake db:migrate
Some times it Giving an error 
A copy of ApplicationController has been removed from the module tree but is still active!
Config/environment/your mode like development.rb
change config.cache_classes=false to true
